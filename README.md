You are lost in a challenge that I can help you. It could be technical or feelings.

##**A funny story**
One day I was in pyjama and I chased away a mouse from my brother's house with his sneakers and I lost it on his neighbour's roof. The door was open and the wind close the door behind me. I didn't have the key and there was nobody at home. So I stayed in pyjama all day outside home waiting my brother's back.
